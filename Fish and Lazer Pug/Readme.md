These games were originally coded on the now AWS service cloud9, and are in the process of being migrated.\
Lazer pug is fully playable, but Fish eat Fish requires some attention to relink assets and fix some code.\
As a personal project, I am hoping to revisit and refurbish these programs.\

### The story
In grade 12, I created a collection of webgames coded in javascript and html.\
While they were somwhat messy, it was a fantastic introduction to the logic behind coding\
My goal was not only to create functional programs, but to also create a game that was fun and engaging.\
I'm hoping to overhaul and condense the code, as well as add functionality in the form of difficulty levels and a greater variety of enemy types and behaviours.
